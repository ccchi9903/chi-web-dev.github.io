The gunman, who was shot dead by police, had a long criminal record, a source close to the investigation told CNN. He was the subject of a "Fiche S" surveillance file and was on the radar of the French domestic security service DGSI, the source said.
A French national, the man shot two officers in 2001 after being stopped by a police car, according to the source. He was taken into custody but while being questioned grabbed another officer's gun and shot him three times, the source added. He was convicted in that attack and had a criminal record because of involvement in violent robberies.

The attack unfolded on the famed Champs-Elysees around 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) when a car stopped in front of a police van, according to French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre Henry Brandet.
A man emerged from the car and opened fire on the van with an "automatic weapon," killing one officer instantly, Brandet said. The man "then ran away, managing to shoot and wound two other policemen. Other policemen engaged and shot and killed the attacker," he added.

French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told France's Europe 1 radio Friday that it's too early to tell what role the second suspect played, if any, in the attack.
"There are probably, possible accomplices that need to be arrested which is why I won't give you additional details," he said.
Three of 11 presidential candidates have halted campaigning after the shooting, which came three days before French voters go to the polls.
Security in Paris has been building in recent days, but the presence of 50,000 police officers on the streets weren't enough to prevent the latest assault, which a source tells CNN is being treated as an act of terror.

In August, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Marycate Walsh told the publication that “leadership is reviewing the Naval Safety Center’s recommendation regarding e-cigarettes, weighing both the safety and health-related risks.”

A Navy memorandum states that 15 “mishaps” occurred between October 2015 and June 15, 2016, that resulted in either injury to Navy personnel or “fire/materiel damage.”

“Eight of these incidents occurred onboard Naval vessels/aircraft,” the memo reads. “Nine of 15 reported incidents described the failure mechanism as explosive. … Two battery explosions occurred with the electronic cigarette in the service member’s mouth resulting in facial and dental injuries.”
</p>

<p>
The memo says the Navy has no record of any such incidents prior to October 2015.

The Navy says there is increased use of e-cigarettes among Navy personnel — and the apparent dangers have been highlighted in Navy publications.

A four-page spread in the Navy magazine Sea Compass titled “Danger: The Hidden Risks of Vaping” tells the story of two sailors who were the victims of an exploding battery. One received first-degree burns, while the other’s car was destroyed by the fire.

“Imagine what would have happened if the batteries had exploded while in their home, the barracks or even onboard their ship,” the article says. “The loss of property and potential loss of life could have been catastrophic.”
As the Navy has noted, the dangers of exploding batteries can be mitigated by properly stowing the devices, using the correct charger, buying equipment from a reputable manufacturer and not modifying it.
The U.S. Air Force Museum said…the Doolittle Raid “…forced the Japanese to recall combat forces for home defense, raised fears among the Japanese civilians and boosted morale among Americans and our allies abroad.”

Tokyo radio broadcast that “enemy bombers appeared over Tokyo for the first time since the outbreak of the current war of Greater East Asia.” …

[CNN reporter Richard Roth interviewed Mr. Cole this week. He wrote: “I asked Cole his secret to living past 101. He simply said, ‘Keep moving.’ He said he would like to be remembered along ‘with the rest of the people that had an impact on winning the war.’ I asked Cole if he felt he was a hero. A quick response. No.’]

<h2><a name = "prohibition"></a>SECOND PART DUMBASS</h2>

“The prohibition applies to Sailors, Marines, Military Sealift Command civilians and any personnel working on or visiting those units,” according to a statement obtained by NPR’s Sarah McCammon, issued by the commanders of the U.S. Fleet Forces and the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

The ban will go into force on May 14 and will “remain in effect until a final determination can be made following a thorough analysis,” the Navy says. At the same time, “sailors on shore will still be allowed to use [Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems] on base, but must do so in designated smoking areas ashore while on military installations.”

The problem is e-cigarette lithium-ion batteries that can explode. Last year, Navy Times reported that the Naval Safety Center called for a full ban of the devices on Navy property, citing their “significant and unacceptable risk.”
</p>

<p>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized its first regulations for e-cigarettes last year.

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) formally banned e-cigarette use on commercial flights last year. The ban is meant to protect other passengers from the vapor, due to a lack of information about the ingredients in e-cigarettes.

A Navy spokesman says regulations allow personnel to smoke tobacco cigarettes on a ship's “smoke deck” at designated times.

Mitchell medium bombers survived. Most crashed in Chinese territory or were ditched at sea.

To commemorate the mission that followed the United States’ entry into World War II, Cole, who is 101 years old, will complete a decades-long tradition of drinking a toast to a deceased Raider and of turning over a goblet belonging to the late fellow member. This year, Cole will toast to David Thatcher, a fellow Raider who died on June 22, and he will turn over Thatcher’s goblet.

“It’s kind of lonely because I’m the last one,” Cole told CNN.
When asked what the 75th anniversary of the attack means to him, Cole, with a twinkle in his eye, said, “It means I’m getting to be an old man.”

In the commemoration event, 17 B-25 bombers were on display and there was a B-1 flyover at the conclusion of the memorial service, in which a wreath was laid.

The last year the ceremony was held was in 2013 because of the Raiders’ ages and increasing difficulty traveling. Four Raiders were still living at that event.
