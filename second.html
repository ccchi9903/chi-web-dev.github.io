MLG: Why the Golden Age of E-Sports Has Finally Arrived
</h1>

<p>
Approximately one year ago, after having attended Major League Gaming's (MLG) 2012 Spring Championships, I wrote an article
about the evolution and emergence of eSports. The article was a primer, of sorts, on eSports, where it had come from and where
it might be heading.
</p>

<p>
One year later, I returned to the Anaheim Convention Center to see how MLG and eSports had progressed.
</p>

<p>
I left even more impressed than I had been a year earlier. 
I also walked out of the Anaheim Convention Center with the realization that not only had eSports arrived
—it very well might be entering into its own Golden Age.
</p>

<p>
One of the biggest things I noticed at the 2013 Spring Championships is that MLG events feel more 
and more like E3 with a ton of great, competitive gaming going on all at the same time.
There are vendors all over the place and a healthy smattering of booth babes to keep things lively. 
Developers and product manufacturers are also in abundance.
</p>

<p>
One of the highlights of the event for me was the Infinite Crisis booth. Infinite Crisis is going to be a Multiplayer 
Online Battle Arena (MoBA) game set in the DC Comics Universe. 
For a comic book and super hero freak like me, it was like getting an early Christmas present.
	That's the thing though. MLG events are now, more than ever before, a perfect merging of sports, pop culture and 
just about everything else. There really is something for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Even if you don't know a particular game, the crowds' various reactions can clue you in to what is going on. 
	You may not know what happened—but you will know it was important.An example of 
	this merging of worlds took place at the 2013 Spring Championships. MLG hosted an All-Star event where some of the best in eSports 
	joined forces with some of the best from the traditional sports world to play Call of Duty Black Ops II.
	You had players like Dez Bryant, Ty Lawson and Dwight Howard all on hand to play Black Ops II in an All-Star game of sorts. 
	That's right, just days before Howard was going to make his decision to leave the Los Angeles Lakers and sign on 
	with the Houston Rockets, he was playing Call of Duty with some well known players and personalities from the eSports world.

<p>
It was one of those moments where we will look back on, several years from now, 
	and might just point to it as saying that was the moment when eSports truly arrived.
</p>

<p>
Statistically, the numbers seem to support the fact that eSports is continuing to become more popular. 
According to VentureBeat.com, the MLG event in Anaheim drew 21,000 spectators and competitors to the Anaheim Convention Center, 
a new record for MLG.That is roughly 1,000 more people than were there for the same event in 2012.
</p>

<p>
Online viewing of matches continues to surge in popularity, and more and more people are interested in eSports, or at least in learning about eSports.

In general, the entire world of eSports is continuing to grow at a steady clip. The co-founder of MLG, Sundance DiGiovanni, was kind enough to spend some time answering my questions at the Anaheim event. He had an interesting take on some of the developments that we have seen in eSports over the past year:

There continues to be incredible developments and progress in the MLG and eSports industry and we have just scratched the surface.  In the last year, we have seen more and more publishers and game developers coming to MLG in the development phase to ensure their games are built with MLG and eSports in mind.  Additionally, we have seen incredible growth in the number of online viewers not only for our big Championship events, but for our daily content at www.majorleaguegaming.com. And the deep engagement and viewing time is through the roof—an average of 169 minutes for our last event, 
	that is longer time spent watching our event than the Super Bowl online this year. We only expect that to increase moving forward.
